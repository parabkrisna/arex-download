TGFbeta-induced switch from adipogenic to osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells\\n', '(Submitter supplied) Gene Expression analysis of a differentiation timeseries of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) in the presence of adipogenic/osteogenic factors. hMSCs differentiate into fat cells when treated with dexamethasone (10^-6 M), insulin (10 ug/ml), rosiglitazone (10^-7 M) and IBMX (250 uM).  TGFbeta (5 ng/ml)  inhibits this process and redirects these cells to differentiate into bone cells. Introduction: Patients suffering from osteoporosis show an increased number of adipocytes in their bone marrow, concomitant with a reduction in the pool of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that are able to differentiate into osteoblasts, thus leading to suppressed osteogenesis. more...\\n', 'Organism:\\tHomo sapiens\\n', 'Type:\\t\\tExpression profiling by array\\n', 'Platform: GPL570 54 Samples\\n', 'FTP download: GEO (CEL) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE84nnn/GSE84500/\\n', 'Series\\t\\tAccession: GSE84500\\tID: 200084500\\n', '\\n', '184.

One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5′ end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. more...\\n', 'Organism:\\tHomo sapiens; Mus musculus\\n', 'Type:\\t\\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other\\n', 'Platforms: GPL16791 GPL17021 28 Samples\\n', 'FTP download: GEO (BED, TAB, TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE78nnn/GSE78040/\\n', 'SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA312400\\n', 'Series\\t\\tAccession: GSE78040\\tID: 200078040\\n', '\\n', '339.

Since mitochondria play key roles in various catabolic and anabolic reactions encompassing lipid metabolism, optimal functioning of mitochondria is critical in preventing various pathologies. Increased amounts of the apolipoprotein O /MIC26 were found in diabetic patients along with lipid accumulation in murine liver upon MIC26 expression.  MIC26 is a MICOS complex constituent present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The functional interplay between MIC26 and cellular metabolome is not understood. Therefore, we employed a multi-omics approach in WT and MIC26 knockout HepG2 cellular models in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions, along with a variety of functional assays. We found that MIC26 is necessary for maintaining glycolysis and lipid metabolism via CPT1A along with cholesterol synthesis in a nutrient-dependent manner.
